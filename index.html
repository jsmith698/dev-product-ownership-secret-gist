        "Group Progress": ["So far the team has been drawing out what the product is going to look like and how it's going to work.
                            We are now in progress of making a main page, tap-to-reply page and a quxt page. How it's set up is that
                            two people are working on quxt while the other two work on tap-to-reply. Although they both are the same,
                            it's just that one involves dealing with text questions while the other one deals with text responses and
                            we are just putting those two together."],
        "Group Improvements": ["The only improvements right now is just trying to find a time to meet up whether it's face to face or zoom
                                to continue developing the product outside of class. Everyone's schedules is kind of all over the place due to some having to work and some
                                who is working with other groups in different classes. The brightside is that we all do keep in contact with each other constantly
                                via group text."]
        "Product Confidence Level": ["I'm confident that our product is going to be successful as the product overall isn't really that difficult.
                                    The product as a whole seems really simple as all it has to do is give the user text response options to choose
                                    from as a way to respond back to the text message. We just have to get it to work and I believe that we're gonna
                                    be successful in getting it to work and run properly."]
        "Group Contribution": ["My job in the group currently involves dealing with css. I'm going to add some color and some designs to the product.
                                Some of which includes making it to where each response box has different colors as some of the responses are also
                                going to be either negative, positive, enthusiastic, and unenthusiastic. I was able to get it to where when
                                the curser is hovering over a response button, it causes the button to become transparent. Now I'm in the process
                                of choosing different box corners and designs on and just pretty much trying to design how the response boxes are going
                                to look."]
